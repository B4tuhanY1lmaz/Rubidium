So you may notice that my blog site was down for the last 2 or 3 weeks and this was mostly becouse some of my things wasn't going right on it's way and I had to shut my server down to keep up but now I came back and decided to create a backup website over at Github Pages under the [blog](https://blog.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz) subdomain. So if my main site is down, I could easly forward my main domain to this subdomain and keep my followers like you on my site. Soon I'll migrate my server to a virtual machine running on a different server in a different location and this way I won't have a need for something like that. 

If you have any ideas you can always email me at[batuhan@thebatuhansnetwork.xyz ](mailto://batuhan@thebatuhansnetwork.xyz) address and I'll try to respond fast as possible. 


## Thank You!
