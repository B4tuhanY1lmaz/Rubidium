title: I'm on diff.blog now!

After being away for some time. I'm back again. I decided to publish my blogsite over the places like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and [diff.blog](https://diff.blog) and this is beginning of that. Hopefully things will go as expected and I'll publish more and more blogposts over the time. I still want to accomplish the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) challenge and this is the 8th post since the day I started. I still have plenty of time left so lets go.

## Thank you!
