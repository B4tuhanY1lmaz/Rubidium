My journey with [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) has began when DistroTube created his own public [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance named distrotoot and since that day I'm an active user of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). Over time I found out that this place was a much better version of Twitter and when Elon Musk brought out Twitter, I deleted my account and switched completely to [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). 

Over the time I found out that [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) isn't just a bunch of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) servers but instead it was a huge collection of platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [[Plemora](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma)](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma), [Calckey](https://calckey.org/), [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/), [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org), [Kbin](https://kbin.pub/en) and much more like that. And if you look close to them you can see that almost all of them has existed as an alternative and continued to improve themselves. Like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and [Plemora](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma) is for Twitter, [Calckey](https://calckey.org/) is for Facebook, [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org) and [Kbin](https://kbin.pub/en) is for Reddit and much more.

We had very good alternatives for most of the big tech platforms expect one. Instagram. If I'm wrong please fix me, as far as I know we didn't had any alternatives on [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) for a platform like Instagram and this is where [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) comes into place. [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) aims to be the Instagram of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) and even tho it's still in beta I can easly say that it does a pretty good job. 

When I discovered it back in March, I didn't wanted to create an account or use it becouse at the beginning I trought that it was just same as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) but with images and than I proved myself wrong and decided to create an account over at [[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/).social](https://[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/).social) and use it as my public photo library. Before [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) I was using Pexels for that and it was completely fine but I wanted to contribute to this platform with my content and this is what I'm doing. 

I'm not actually using it as a replacement for Instagram becouse the only use of the Instagram was comminicating with my friends and nothing more. But if you wanna replace [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) with Instagram you can also [import your data from Instagram](https://[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/).blog/p/2023/feature/introducing-import-from-instagram) and enjoy the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) as the way you like.

So in the end, we have [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) becouse we need it for the perfect Fediverse possible.
