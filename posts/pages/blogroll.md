title: Blogroll.
---
I've been following these blogs for some time and after seeing Blogroll on other blogs. You may see the [Webring](https://thebatuhansnetwork.xyz/adding-rss-feeds-from-other-blogs-to-end-of-my-posts/) at the end of my posts and it only contains a small amouth of the blogs I do follow. 

I've added the RSS feeds for the blogs becouse RSS is the thing that makes blogs more reachable and easier to follow.
