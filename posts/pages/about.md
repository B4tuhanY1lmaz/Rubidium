## Who am I?
My name is Batuhan Yılmaz and I’m an 18 year old high school student who interested in lot’s of things. I do live in Nevşehir, Turkey. I’m a 12th grade student and a computer nerd on my own. I’m also interested in designing stuff and when I get my school done I’m planning to hop into this colorfull world of the designers and web developing.
I love keeping things simple so this about page is gonna be an oversimplified page.
I love technology and generally I do write about my adventures with it or experiences with life with keeping myself a bit off topic.
