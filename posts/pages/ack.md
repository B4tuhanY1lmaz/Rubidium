title: Acknowledge of 2022
---
As my last words of 2022, I want to say thanks to everyone who made 2022 an awesome year for me. I really can’t imagine how 2022 would’ve been without them. I’m not just talking about the people I talk to in my life. I’m also talking about the people on my Discord server. You guys are just awesome in every way, and I want to thank you for making the last two years of my life awesome! I wish you all have the best in 2023.
